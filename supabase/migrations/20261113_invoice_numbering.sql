-- Unbroken invoice numbering per fiscal year (PRO-141; DGI spec v2.0, 2.18 /
-- section 3 m: a unique number for each invoice, in an unbroken ascending
-- series for each fiscal year).
--
-- Until now an invoice's id was also its number, and it was taken when the
-- invoice was created, drafts included: deleting or abandoning a draft left a
-- gap, and the series never restarted.
--
-- 1. invoices.number is the legal number, e.g. FACT-2026-0001. The database
--    gives it when the invoice is first issued (leaves draft), in the same
--    transaction, from a series per organisation and per calendar year (the
--    OHADA fiscal year). If the transaction fails, the number isn't used. Drafts
--    have no number. `id` stays as the internal key (line items, payments,
--    credit notes and journal entries point to it).
-- 2. Credit notes get credit_notes.number the same way (AV-2026-0001), when
--    they're created (they have no draft state).
-- 3. Issued invoices and credit notes can't be deleted, and a numbered invoice
--    can't go back to draft: an issued invoice is cancelled with a credit note.
--    The Supabase dashboard / SQL editor and the service role still can.
--
-- Invoices and credit notes issued before this migration keep their current
-- number (their id).
